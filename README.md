# Example project for RWD using plain Java API

An example project that presents some "Responsive Web Design" implemented with human readable Java code instead of html and Css haxies. Look at the ResponsiveVaadinUI class where all interesting stuff happens. The app does not try to look good but to have clean and easy to understand examples for your inspiration.
