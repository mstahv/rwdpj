                # Utilizing Flexbox and Css Grid layouts instead of breakpoints
                
                With the help of the modern browser layouting, you can often accomplish good results for different
                browser sized without explicit breakpoints, whether they were implemented with or without Java. 
                
                Flexbox and Css Grid layouts are naturally available for Java developers as well, but we are missing
                a ton of examples (and probably some helper components) to make them usage easier. I'm periodically
                teasing our very own Rolf Smeds (who sits on the roadmap of our Design System team), slightly tongue in the 
                cheak,  that *we could solve 80% of the responsive needs by our customers by introducing a component 
                called HorizontalLayoutThatWraps* ðŸ¤£
                
                Well, Rolf has been buried under other requests, so I present you: **the HorizontalLayoutThatWraps**. Implemented based on the 
                FlexLayout component, with a single meaningful configuration line (*setFlexWrap(FlexWrap.WRAP);*) that makes the flexbox row wrap
                the components when they no more fit to the space available horizontally. Although being quite trivial,
                this is a good example how you can efficiently utilize the available screen estate, completely without 
                breakpoint base logic.
                
                With Flexbox and Css Grid there is plenty of other possibilities, but naturally the rather "extreme
                flexibility" can also make things rather complex and decrease the maintainability. I suggest to package
                your "recipes" with Flexbox and Css Grid into classes, both for improved readability and re-usability.
                And help me to remind Rolf periodically that we (Java developers) would really benefit of a couple of
                well named (and designed) presets for these complex layout components ðŸ§¸  
                
                """));

        class HorizontalLayoutThatWraps extends FlexLayout {
            public HorizontalLayoutThatWraps() {
                setFlexWrap(FlexWrap.WRAP);
            }
        }

        var horizontalLayoutThatWraps = new HorizontalLayoutThatWraps();
        IntStream.rangeClosed(1,15).forEach(i ->
                horizontalLayoutThatWraps.add(new Card("Card"+i))
        );
        add(horizontalLayoutThatWraps);
    }
}
